# Vanishing Koans

This project aims to have a little fun and explore some javascript/css/typescript.

The original app from the tutorial fetches a list of posts by user with some functionality to toggle display. 

My idea is to transform this app to one that fetches poems or Koans that vanish after a set amount of time.
