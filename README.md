# Vanishing Koans

## [Github Pages Deployment](https://airbr.github.io/vanillajsapp/)

#### [Based on a ES6 'vanilla.js' introduction by Jeremy Likness ](https://dev.to/jeremylikness/vanilla-js-getting-started-1e3j)

This project aims to have a little fun and explore some javascript/css

The original app from the tutorial fetches a list of posts by user with some functionality to toggle display. 

My idea is to transform this basic app into a app that fetches poems that vanish after a set amount of time.
